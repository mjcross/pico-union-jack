This is my code to test a cheap colour LCD graphics display for the Pico.
It draws a Union Jack into a frame buffer and then transfers it to the display.
It's not exactly fast, but it works well!

The application is in speed-test/speed_test/main.c

For hook-up details see README.md in 'ILI9341_driver_LCD/speed-test'
